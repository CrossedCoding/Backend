11/19 team leader standup
team 1 - Yesterday, went over security options for validation and authentication. 
	Firebase was selected as it creates the token for you to verify against their API. 
	Did a bunch of research about using Spring Security. The team 1 channel has flow diagrams to depict how they intend to implement.
	Today will continue looking into getting firebase and spring security working together. 
	Assigning roles to firebase accounts and how to pass those role to our servers.
	Time permitting, they begin working in pairs on implementation. 
	
team 2 - Made mock diagrams of their component views. Models, controllers and repo made for doctor and nurse. 
	Registration page exists. Nurse home page has created a component. Email form validation implemented. 
	Were told that the primary keys for doctors and nurses need to be strings as that it was firebase will generate.
	Today, will continue working on doctor component. Will meet up with diagnosis team after lunch to share patient model.
	
team 3 - Designed the logo. Started working on covid verification(front end done) and the rooms page. Think they may be able to finish the covid form backend today. 
	Want to meet up with team 2 as well to discuss the nurse and doctor models. 
	
team 4 - Yesterday, we worked on models for patient, diagnosis form. 
	Their were a couple of dependencies that we needed to comment out to get things working. 
	Today will get controllers working and hope to start to on the front end. 
	Asked about whether the nurse page team will handle patient checkin or if team 4 will take care of this.
